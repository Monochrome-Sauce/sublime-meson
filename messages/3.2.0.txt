                  Meson v3.2.0
                  ============

The code was slightly refactored to more easily use Meson as a tool.

Changes and fixes:
- Paths passed to the package's commands can now contain spaces and other elements such as dashes.
- Commands are now properly executed relative to the root of the project.
- Now the command input indicator in the panel will always be present, even without entering a command.
