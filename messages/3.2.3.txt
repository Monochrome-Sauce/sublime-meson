                  Meson v3.2.3
                  ============

Add 'meson compile.sublime-build' and 'meson setup.sublime-build'.
Run them in projects containing 'meson.build' files by opening the command
palette and writing "Build With: meson".

Please open an issue on the GitHub page if there are any problems.
The commands `Meson: Compile` and `Meson: Setup` *may* become deprecated in the
future.
