                  Thanks for trying out the Meson package!
                  ========================================

This package adds syntax definitions and a few commands for using the Meson
build system with Sublime Text.
The syntax supports meson.build and meson-options.txt files.
Settings are available in Preferences > Package Settings > Meson > Settings

To view available commands, simply open the Command Palette (cmd+shift+p on OS X,
ctrl+shift+p on Linux/Windows) and type "Meson:".

The package requires the Meson build tool to be installed to be installed.
