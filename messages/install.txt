                  Thanks for trying out the Meson package!
                  ========================================

This package adds syntax definitions and a few commands for using the Meson
build system with Sublime Text.
There syntax supports meson.build and meson-options.txt files.

To view available commands, simply open the Command Palette (cmd+shift+p on OS X,
ctrl+shift+p on Linux/Windows) and type "Meson:".

The package requires Meson to be installed.
